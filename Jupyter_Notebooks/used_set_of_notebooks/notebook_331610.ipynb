Let's review the [rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life):\n","\n","The *world* of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of *cells*, each of which is in one of two possible states, *live* or *empty*. Each cell has eight *neighbors*, the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following rules are applied to create the next *generation*:\n","\n","+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n","+ Any empty cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation.\n","+ All other cells are empty in the next generation.\n","\n","For example, in the diagram below, \"`@`\" cells are live. In the transition from Generation 0 to 1, the cell marked \"`,`\" becomes empty (dies off) because it has zero live neighbors.  In the next transition, a fourth `@` becomes live, because it has 3 live neighbors. All other cells stay the same.\n","\n","     . . . . .      . . . . .      . . . . .\n","     . . . @ .      . . . , .      . . . . .\n","     . @ . . .      . @ . . .      . @ @ . .\n","     . @ @ . .      . @ @ . .      . @ @ . .\n","     . . . . .      . . . . .      . . . . .\n","       Gen 0          Gen 1          Gen 2\n","     \n","\n","\n","The world continues to evolve by these rules for as long as you care to observe.\n","\n","# Developing a Life Program\n","\n","\n","To create a program to play Life, start with the vocabulary of concepts:\n","\n","+ **World**\n","+ **Cell**\n","+ **Live/Empty**\n","+ **Neighbors**\n","+ **Next Generation**\n","+ **Display**\n","+ **Live Neighbor Counts**\n","\n","and consider how to implement them:\n","\n","+ **World**: The state of the world must represent which cells are empty and which are live. The tricky part is that the number of cells is infinite, and we can't store an infinite array in a finite computer.  I can think of three ways to deal with this problem:\n","  1. **Change the rules**; make the world finite instead of infinite. (Cells at the edge of the world have fewer neighbors, or perhaps they wrap around to the other side of the world.)\n","  2. Use a **finite rectangular window** that covers all the live cells in the infinite grid. As the world\n","  evolves, this window may have to grow or shift.\n","<br>Example: `world = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]`\n","\n","  3. Represent a world as a **set of live cells.**  This set will grow and shrink in size from one generation to the next, but we don't have to worry about overflowing the edges of an array.\n","<br>Example: `world = {(3, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}`\n","<br>I will go with this choice.\n","\n","\n","+ **Cell**: Each cell will be represented as an (x, y) pair of integer coordinates. <br>Example: `cell = (1, 2)`.\n","+ **Live/Empty**:\n","A cell is live if it is a member of the set of live cells.\n","<br>Example: \"`cell in world`\" is True, given the definition of `cell` and `world` above, so `cell` is live.\n","+ **Neighbors**:  The cell `(x, y)` has eight neighbors, formed by adding or subtracting 1 from `x` or `y` or both. We can define\n","a function `neighbors(cell)` to return this set.\n","<br>Example: `neighbors((8, 8)) == [(7, 7), (8, 7), (9, 7), (7, 8), (9, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9), (9, 9)]`\n","\n","+ **Display**: We will need some way to display the state of the world. Let's defer that for now.\n","\n","+ **Next Generation**: We can define a function, `next_generation(world)`, that takes a world as input and returns\n","a new world with the new set of live cells according to the rules.\n","Example: `next_generation({(3, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}) == {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)}`\n","\n","+ **Live Neighbor Counts**: I need to know how many live neighbors each cell has. A good way to represent this is a dict of `{(x, y): count}`. But which cells need to be the keys of this dict? We can start with the live cells, and also add any cells neighboring the live cells. An easy way to generate this dict is to create a `Counter` and pass it every neighbor of every live cell. This may feel like we're doing the counting \"backwards.\" Instead of asking \"for each cell, how many live neighbors does it have?\" we are saying \"for each live cell, increment the count of each of its neighbors.\" The two amount to the same thing because *neighbor* is symmetric&mdash;if P is a neighbor of Q, then Q is a neighbor of P. Below we see the neighbor counts for each of the three generations; in each generation the top diagram gives the neighbor counts for the empty cells, and the bottom diagram gives the counts for the live cells. This is just to make the diagram easier to read; in the code these are combined into one `Counter`. Here are the counts:\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","     . . 1 1 1      . . . . .      . . . . .\n","     1 1 2 @ 1      1 1 1 , .      1 2 2 1 .\n","     2 @ 4 2 1      2 @ 3 1 .      2 @ @ 2 .\n","     2 @ @ 1 .      2 @ @ 1 .      2 @ @ 2 .\n","     1 2 2 1 .      1 2 2 1 .      1 2 2 1 .\n","       Gen 0          Gen 1          Gen 2\n","     . . . . .      . . . . .      . . . . .\n","     . . . 0 .      . . . , .      . . . . .\n","     . 2 . . .      . 2 . . .      . 3 3 . .\n","     . 2 2 . .      . 2 2 . .      . 3 3 . .\n","     . . . . .      . . . . .      . . . . .\n","     \n","\n","Here is the implementation.
