The WDPA comes in two databases: one with polygons reporting the protected areas for which shapes are known, and another one with points of the areas for which shapes are not known. I am not too much interested in the count of areas, but the actual land they cover. Hence I will assess that in the following.\n",

    "> Where boundary data is unavailable, the latitude and longitude of the centermost point of the site is requested as a reference point for the protected area instead. Although this is strongly encouraged, data providers are not always able to submit such information. Therefore, it should not be assumed that all points in the WDPA represent a central point of a given site. If the protected area is made up of multiple parts, multi- points associated with the central locations of each part of the protected area may be stored instead (see Figure 2.2).\n",

A simple approach would be to draw a circle around that centroid with the reported area size and use that as an estimation of the real protected area. A difficulty here would be the areas that are represented by more than one point. Let's find out how many of those there are and how to handle them."
