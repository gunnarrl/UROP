CAST collected 24 hours of heart rate data from ECGs from people who have had a myocardial infarction (MI) within the past two years.[1] This data has been smoothed and resampled to more closely resemble PPG-derived pulse rate data from a wrist wearable.[2]\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **For women, we see ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For women, we see the expected trend, where average resting heart rate increases up until middle age, then decreases into old age.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For men, we see ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For men, we do not see the expected trend, at least for the 35-79 year-old segments. In fact, resting heart rate appears to be dropping throughout this age range.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **In comparison to men, women's heart rate is ...**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Women's heart rate is generally higher than it is for men until the late 60s. \n",
    "    - It demonstrates the expected trend in heart rate, while men do not. \n",
    "    - In addition, women's heart rate is is much more variable. While men's heart rates cluster close to the mean within the 95% confidence interval, women's heart rates show a large variation, especially for the 35-54 year-old age range. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are some possible reasons for what we see in our data**?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Women may have higher heart rates because of physiological reasons, perhaps because their hearts are smaller, on average, compared to the volume of blood that must be pumped. Therefore they must pump more frequently. \n",
    "    - The lack of expected trend in our data for men might be due to a high level of fitness with respect to the general population. It could also be that heart rate peaks earlier for men than age 35. \n",
    "    - The greater variation in our data for women may be due to smaller sample size. There may be a lot more men in the sample than women, so the 95th confidence interval appears wider. Another reason might be that the variation in health of the women was much greater than the variation in health conditions for men in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What else can we do or go and find to figure out what is really happening? How would that improve the results?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - To figure out what is really happening, we could try to identify the level of fitness based on subject data. We can also conduct additional exploratory data analyses, determining the number of women versus the number of men, and the ratio of women to men at every age grouping. \n",
    "    - Based on our findings from this research and anlaysis, we could try to improve the results by enlarging the dataset to include a wider variation of fitness levels for men, and a larger number of subjects who are women.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Did we validate the trend that average resting heart rate increases up until middle age and then decreases into old age? How?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We validated the trend that average resting heart rate increases up until middle age and then decreases into old age for women.\n",
    "    - However, we could not validate this trend for men. We only see that the heart rate decreases over time from age 35 to age 79."
