Using SAT scores as a basis of whether to admit a student or not has created some controversy. Among other things, people question whether the SATs are fair and whether they predict college performance.\n","This study examines the SAT and GPA information of 105 students who graduated from a state university with a B.S. in computer science. Using the grades and test scores from high school, can you predict a student's college grades?\n","\n","\n","\n","##### Questions to Answer\n","Can the math and verbal SAT scores be used to predict college GPA?
