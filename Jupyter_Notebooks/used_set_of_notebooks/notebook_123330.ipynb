Indeed, we did so in the [initial draft](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/20/237446), but interpretation proved difficult. On the left, it seems like the gene levels are mostly in agreement (spread around the $y = x$ line) but there are many exceptions, with genes present at the 1% level in FACS that are entirely absent in droplets. On the right, the bulk of the genes are slightly above the diagonal (present in a larger fraction of cells in droplets than in FACS), but many genes are on the x-axis. That means they were almost never observed in the droplet data but often seen in the FACS data. Confusingly, in other cell types the majority of genes are _below_ the diagonal, indicating they are more often found in the FACS data.\n",

    "The difference between these plots is pretty striking. In the droplet data on the left, the relationship between expression and dropout looks like something we can model: genes that are highly expressed are more likely to be observed in every cell, while low-expression genes are seen less often. This relationship is what we would expect from a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), with a little additional noise due to variation in library depth and gene expression. If we model these sources of variation as a [gamma distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) then the resulting model for observed counts is a [negative binomial](http://www.nxn.se/valent/2018/1/30/count-depth-variation-makes-poisson-scrna-seq-data-negative-binomial). Deviations from that model are a sign of heterogeneity in gene expression&mdash;perhaps indicating a mixture of cell types or cell states. This suggests a method for finding variable genes; Tallulah Andrews and Martin Hemberg describe such a method in [their paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/17/065094) on bioR$\\chi$iv.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot is more confusing. The same trend is apparent but the points are much more spread out and cloudier compared to the data from droplets. We see a faint echo of the droplet curve on the left side of the plot, but most of the points are further to the right. If we assumed a negative binomial for these data we would identify a huge number of genes as variable, but we know this population of cells is relatively homogenous (probably as homogenous as the cells in the droplet data).\n",
    "\n",
    "There must be an additional source of noise, and the obvious suspect is the [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) amplification during library preparation. The droplet data has unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) that removed this noise, while the FACS data does not, and the result is what we see. One way to test this idea is to model how we think the data are generated and see if we can reproduce these trends."

There is a clear difference between these two effects: noise in the size of the library makes the Poisson-derived curve slightly \"fuzzier\", but it also raises the bottom end of the distribution because the cells with high coverage are able to recover rare genes. Noise in the gene expression lowers the top line and spreads out the distribution, because genes are less evenly distributed and so they are found in fewer cells than would be expected based on average expression.

We can model this with a mixture of two beta distributions, although it's unclear why that should be the case.

    "This looks pretty good, but when we compare it to our data it's still not quite right. The bimodal distribution gave us a subpopulation of points on the left side of the plot, but it didn't give us the relationship between expression and PCR efficiency that we can see in the FACS data. We could reproduce that relationship in a hacky way, by setting a random subset of low-expression genes to have low PCR efficiency.

The number of distinct fragments we see from a gene will depend on its expression level, because a highly-expressed gene will be sampled more often. A single fragment might be all that we capture from a gene with low expression. If that fragment has poor PCR efficiency, that gene would remain on the UMI curve, part of the \"shadow\" that we expect. We can try this out by changing our model to work on gene fragments rather than genes. We add a step at the beginning, generating a random number of fragments for each gene (Poisson distributed) and assigning each _fragment_ its own PCR efficiency. We'll show the results of both the UMI distribution and the PCR-amplified version."

    "Without using UMIs to deduplicate the read data, we see a very similar story to the plot of FACS data up above, consistent with our model of how PCR bias can add noise to read counts. Of note, the cloud of amplified reads is not shifted so far to the right as it was in the plot of FACS data. While both protocols have about the same number of PCR cycles, it appears that the efficiency of PCR in the 10X library is somewhat lower overall: 20-30x amplification rather than the >100x amplification in the FACS data. Those numbers suggest that PCR is somewhere around 30% efficient in the 10X library and 50-60% efficient in the Smart-Seq2 protocol. However, the analysis above shows that higher efficiency is not necessarily desirable&mdash;variation in efficiency leads to a lot of noise in gene counts, and in the absence of UMIs this can make analysis more challenging. When UMIs are present, higher amplification will just reduce the effective depth of the library.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end we've built a relatively simple model of PCR and sampling, and it produces data that look qualitatively like the data we really observed. One open question is whether the distribution of PCR efficiencies is realistic. A bimodal distribution _might_ reflect that some proportion of cDNA sequences form dimers or otherwise impede PCR, but a unimodal distribution is more intuitive. It's possible that we're missing yet another mechanism in this process that would naturally lead to the behavior we're seeing.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this blog post is mostly about trying to understand a particularly confusing plot, it was not a purely theoretical exercise. There are a few ideas that arise from this model of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **UMIs are really useful.** Looking at these plots and how they are affected by noise has emphasized the importance of UMIs for getting a good estimate of gene expression. By having a strong statistical model for how the data are generated, we can more easily identify genes with heterogeneous expression within a cluster. This level of detail is much more difficult to resolve when read counts are affected by amplification noise.\n",
    " 2. **Too much PCR is likely harmful.** We spent a fair amount of time trying to recreate the shadow on the left side of the FACS plot, but we haven't discussed the implications of that shadow. According to our model, those are genes that have very low PCR efficiency and may not have been amplified at all during the second PCR step. Nevertheless, we are recovering those reads from the sequencer at a rate consistent with their expression. This suggests that we might be able to optimize our protocols by doing fewer rounds of library amplification. That would allow us to improve our sequencing throughput, either by sequencing more cells at once or by sequencing the same number of cells much more deeply.\n",
    " 3. **We should be able to fill in our matrix.** When we are confident that we have a homogenous cluster of cells, the plots above show us a natural method of imputing gene expression values when they are missing, even in the face of PCR noise. The proportion of cells with ≥1 read is a good predictor of the number of UMIs in each cell, and this holds true even when the reads themselves are subjected to a biased PCR process. The points in the second plot have shifted to the right but not up or down, so it's possible the effect of amplification can be removed by fitting a curve to the top left of the graph. However, when we are not confident of a homogenous population this becomes much riskier, and it is harder to have that confidence in the face of noisy reads.\n",
